	<!--
	List here the keys of the security keychain items that must be protected by passcode.
	ONLY FOR iOS devices (available since iOS 8 and for iPhone 5s and above devices)

	This is a expanded feature in the Security Keychain that includes the use of ACLs.

	A device with Touch ID enabled will first request the user to enter the fingerprint
	in order to get the value of any protected key, or passcode (as a second choice)

	This protection implies:
		- access to these security keychain items is limited to this device
		and requires a passcode to be set
		- and the data is only available if the device is currently unlocked.
		- if the user removes the passcode on the device, these items are automatically removed.
		- if a request to the keychain returns multiple matching items,
		authentication may be required (if any of hte items are passcode protected)
